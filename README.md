# Big Query Public Dataset <a name='bigquery'></a>

[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/introduction) is a fully-managed enterprise data warehouse that helps you manage and analyze your data with built-in features like machine learning, geospatial analysis, and business intelligence. 

The public datasets are datasets that [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data) hosts for you to access and integrate into your applications. Google pays for the storage of these datasets and provides public access to the data via a project. 

Public datasets are available for you to analyze using either legacy SQL or standard SQL queries. 

> Use a fully qualified table name when querying public datasets,

```sql
bigquery-public-data.database-name.table-name.
```

Most of the datasets I've dealt with here are available as CSV files on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) as well. I've implemented this on mmy local with the help of Jupyter notebooks and respective libraries. 

# Pre-Requisites <a name='pre-requisite'></a>

To acess and perform analysis on my local system, I have used Jupyter notebooks and a few other Python libraries. 

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNjXL9KbN4w&t=240s) is a wonderful tutorial I found on how to get started with Anaconda & Jupyter.

Ensuring that yoou have `pip` already installed, here are a few other libraries that you might also require. 

* google-api-python-client
* google-cloud-bigquery
* pyarrow (optional)
* pandas
* scikit-learn (optional)

ðŸ’¡ These libraries can be installed either directly in your notebook workspace / terminal mode inside the folder where pip is installed using the following command:

```python
pip install pandas
```

Have you got an awesome project from an existing Kaggle dataset or wish to add onto mine? 

> To clone this repo into your local system, use the following command on a Command Prompt/Terminal or [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)

```git
git clone https://github.com/iaks23/Kaggle_Dataset_Analysis.git
```
