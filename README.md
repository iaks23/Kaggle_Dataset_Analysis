# Big Query Public Dataset <a name='bigquery'></a>

The public datasets are datasets that [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data) hosts for you to access and integrate into your applications. Google pays for the storage of these datasets and provides public access to the data via a project. 

Public datasets are available for you to analyze using either legacy SQL or standard SQL queries. 

> Use a fully qualified table name when querying public datasets,

```sql
bigquery-public-data.database-name.table-name.
```

Most of the datasets I've dealt with here are available as CSV files on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) as well. I've implemented this on mmy local with the help of Jupyter notebooks and respective libraries.
